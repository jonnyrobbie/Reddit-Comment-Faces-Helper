**Easily add comment faces to reddit comments**

This script adds 'Add a comment face' link to the comment area. Clicking that, you are presented with a database of available comment faces which are supported by your subreddit, and you can easily choose a face or add any auxillary text.

How to install user scripts:
============================

 - Firefox and related browsers: [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).
 - Google Chrome, Chromium, and related browsers: [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).
 - Opera (version 15 and later): [Tampermonkey](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/) or [Violentmonkey](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/violent-monkey/).
 - Opera version 12 and earlier [supports user scripts natively](http://www.opera.com/docs/userjs/using/#writingscripts). [Violentmonkey](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/violent-monkey/) provides a friendlier UI and better compatibility.
 - other browsers may have its specific way to run userscripts.

Once user scripts are enabled in your browser, browse to a script on Greasy Fork and click the green "Install this script" button.
