**Easily add comment faces to reddit comments**

This script adds 'Add a comment face' link to the comment area. Clicking that, you are presented with a database of available comment faces which are supported by your subreddit, and you can easily choose a face or add any auxillary text.

Changelog:

Why a userscript and not Add-on, Extension, etc, ...?
=====================================================

Userscripts are platform independant. It allows me to maintain only a single repository, a single codebase for all browsers. I don't have to recompile, repackage, port and whatever for every browser separately. Add-ons can provide some benefits for larger projects, but this userscript is small enough.
